## Conversion from latin1 to utf8:

Based on advice from: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Convert_latin1_to_UTF-8_in_MySQL

    From the Bash shell:
    $ mysqldump -uroot -p -hlocalhost --default-character-set=latin1 -c --insert-ignore --skip-set-charset -r wine_dump.sql wine
    $ file wine_dump.sql
    > wine_dump.sql: Non-ISO extended-ASCII English text, with very long lines
    $ iconv -f ISO8859-1 -t UTF-8 wine_dump.sql > wine_dump_utf8.sql
    $ sed -i 's/latin1/utf8/g' wine_dump_utf8.sql

    Now, from the MySQL command line:
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE sommelier CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

    And finally, back in the Bash shell:
    $ mysql -uroot --max_allowed_packet=16M -p --default-character-set=utf8 sommelier < wine_dump_utf8.sql
