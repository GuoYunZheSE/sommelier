\begin{abstract}
    In this project I implement a recommender system as a web service for wine recommendations. As a starting point the I use the wines, authors and ratings data from wine website Decanter.com, and implement a RESTful web API for accessing wine and author information, augmenting the results with recommendations for other wines or authors.
    The system is written in the Python language, using a MySQL database. The API is built using the Flask framework.
    Implementing a primitive collaborative filtering system but finding my source data to be exceptionally sparse for recommendation, I explore and implement imputation techniques using matrix factorization and singular value decomposition in an attempt to boost the system's ability to make good recommendations.
    I find that both matrix factorization and singular value decomposition improve the recommendation quality of the system, but I am unable to satisfactorily test these systems.
