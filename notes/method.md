# Work plan

## Initial coding

 - Implement user-based CF and then item-based CF following guidelines in Ch.2 of Collective Intelligence (substituting scipy methods for hand-rolled ones).
 - Use test dataset (Movielens)
 - Migrate codebase to use Decanter data
 - Iterate on item-based filtering, with ideas from literature (Su et al. and others)

## Take stock
 
 - What kind of recommendations are we getting
 - What is the difference between wine and movies?
 - How can we incorporate the tasting notes? NLTK to break up into tags?
