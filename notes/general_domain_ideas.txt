Wine app

An application which recommends wines to users based on their preferences and behaviour.

The system will consist of:
 - a database of wines, with their associated meta information
 - a JSON based, HTTP REST interface for accessing and acting upon the database

The user will be able to:
 - create and share notes and ratings of wines in the database
 - view notes and ratings by other users
 - receive recommendations of wines based on their own preferences and notes

 - Time decay? Use drink YY-YY data to determine?
 - Recommendation up/down voting to train recommendations?
 - Cold start problem: alleviated by fact that items entered 'rich'?
 -

Domain questions
 - What is a good wine recommendation?
    Similarity
      Shared qualities
        Grape, region etc.
        Taste profile: adjectives
    Interestingness
      Wines the user would be interested in trying, buying, or otherwise finding out more about     
    
    Low mean absolute error (MAV)

Domain characteristics
 - Many items
 - Many dimensions for categorisation (colour, region, grape variety, sweetness)
 - Sparseness of data. Like movies, most people wont rate most wines
 - Requirement for scalability: recommendations must be fast

Validation
 - Mean absolute error

Methods (as described in Su et al. 2007, IEEE Int. Conf. on Web Intel.)
 - CF
  - Item
  - User
 - Content-based
 - Hybrid
  - Weighted Pearson correlation + naïve Bayes
  - Sequential mixture CF (proposed by Su et al. 2007) = Tree augmented naïve Bayes + extended logistic regression (TAN-ELR)
  - Joint mixture CF (proposed by Su et al. 2007) = 3 separate experts: Pearson correlation-based CF, TAN-ELR content-based predictor, TAN-ELR model-based CF.
