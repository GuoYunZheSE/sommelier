\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusions}

In many ways this project can be considered successful. Some objectives have been achieved well, such as that I have developed an API for the Decanter.com wine tasting data, and augmented the responses with recommendations.

The components of the system are fairly decoupled. I have successfully abstracted away a great deal of complexity, so that between classes there is little data shared, and the system's components operate largely independently of each other. In general I am very happy with the system's architecture.

It was always my goal, however, to be able to assert that the recommendations are good, which I am not able to do. Additionally, I have not succeeded in exploiting anything specific to wines when making my recommendations. The recommender I have produced is no different to one that might produce movie recommendations, or recommendations for any other generic rated item.

On balance I don't think that I managed my time as well as I could, and the project is less successful as a result.
