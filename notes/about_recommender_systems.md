# Recommender systems

## What are the origins of recommender systems

Resnick and Varian (1997) coined the term "recommender system" to describe a system that "assists and augments" the
"natural social process" of recommendation, preferring it to the more narrow "collaborative filtering"
used by Goldberg et al. (1992) to describe their Tapestry system. 

Since the 1990s recommender systems have become ubiquitous. The growth of the world wide web has enabled companies
to collect unprecedented amounts of data from their users, while at the same time making it easier than ever to reach their 
users with suggestions. Companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Twitter use various kinds of recommender system
to recommend such things as products, movies, news stories, or indeed other users which a user might be interested in. As
such there has been a proliferation of techniques developed for making recommendation. These techniques fall into a
number of categories, which include collaborative, content-based, demographic, utiliy-based and knowledge-based (Burke,
 2002).
