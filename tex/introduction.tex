\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Recommender Systems.}

Since their origin in the mid-1990s with systems such as Tapestry \cite{Goldberg92} and GroupLens \cite{Resnick94}, recommender systems have become ubiquitous on the World Wide Web, being employed by some of the worlds largest online businesses as core parts of their offering to users.

Companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Twitter use recommender systems to make all manner of suggestions to their users. These recommendations include such things as products, movies, news stories and other interesting users. 

It is the growth of the Web, which is now ubiquitous itself, that has given companies the ability to draw on unprecedented amounts of data about their users' preferences. At the same time the Web has made it easier than ever to reach their users with tailored suggestions.

Amazon's system of product recommendations using item-to-item collaborative filtering is regarded as a ``killer feature''\cite{Fortune12}, and is one of the defining features of the Amazon brand experience. Amazon state their mission to be, ``to delight our customers by allowing them to serendipitously discover great products''\cite{Fortune12}.

Guy et. al. \cite{Guy11} describe social recommender systems as, ``a class of recommender systems that target the social media domain''. The social media domain

\paragraph{Service Oriented Architecture.}

\paragraph{Aims and Objectives.}

I aim to produce a recommender system for wines which takes advantage of both ratings and tasting notes to recommend both interesting wines and interesting users to users of the system.

Rather than implement a full graphical interface for the system I have chosen to develop an HTTP API.

In doing so I will explore the field of recommender systems, 

What is a social recommender system?

Why are these systems interesting - Benefits - Challenges

Typical applications...  - Movies - Products (i.e. Amazon)

Applications in wine domain - what's the same - what's different

What will this project do?  - implement a recommender system for wines -
exploration of techniques etc.
